Background History

I originally created this after wating a funny video on google called Look Around You: The Brain. I created a mockup of one of the experiments in the video. I had given it out to a few people without any scripts. Much later, Tuna Oddfellow invited me to one of his odd balls so that he could melt my brain. It triggered a memory of this little experiment and I went to work on scripting it to respond to people when it is touched. I then hooked in pandorabots into the back to have a conversation with people.
