# Brain Experiment #2

Feed and talk to a brain. 

This was originally for display to make people laugh, but was eventually wired up to Pandorabots.com which provides a chatbot API for ALICE based chatbots.

You can touch different parts of the display to get different responses from the brain. Touching the phone starts and stops a session with the brain via Pandorabots.

## Background

I was originally inspired to build this after watching a parody video, "Look Around You: The Brain", Season 1, Episode 8. A scientist holds up a jar of nuts to a brain in a jar. The brain calls the scientist to tell them how many nuts are in the jar, and is rewarded with brain flakes for getting the correct answer.

Google Video Beta was archived after acquiring YouTube. Here is the original (broken) link:

I've since found the video posted elsewhere.
