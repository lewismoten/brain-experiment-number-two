# Brain Experiment #2

Feed and talk to a brain. 

This was originally for display to make people laugh, but was eventually wired up to Pandorabots.com which provides a chatbot API for ALICE based chatbots.

You can touch different parts of the display to get different responses from the brain. Touching the phone starts and stops a session with the brain via Pandorabots.

## Background

I was originally inspired to build a brain after watching a parody video, "Look Around You: The Brain". Unfortunately, I can not find the original video. Google Video Beta was archived after acquiring YouTube. Here is the original link:

The Internet Archive's Way Back Machine found the web page from 2006. The video was called, "Look Around You The Brain" posted by Peter Packard. Upon further digging, this is Season 1, Episode 8. I've found a few smaller clips of it, but nothing with Brain Experiment #2.
